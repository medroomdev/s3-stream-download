## Documentation

### new S3StreamDownload(s3, s3Params, options)

Creates a new instance of a multipart download stream.  This is a readable stream that can be
piped into other streams.

__Arguments__

* `s3` - Configured aws-sdk s3 instance.  Should be preconfigured with any credentials.
* `s3Params` - Params object that would normally be passed to s3.getObject()
* `options` - Options
    - `downloadChunkSize` - Size of each chunk in bytes.  Defaults to 5MB.
    - `concurrentChunks` - Number of chunks to download concurrently. Defaults to 5.
    - `retries` - How many times a failed chunk should be retried before failing the entire download. Retries will exponentially backoff to allow for recovery.  Defaults to 5.
    - `onLoad` - Callback for when the information of the object is retrieved from s3.
    - `onPart` - Callback for when a part is downloaded.
